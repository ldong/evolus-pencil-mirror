      <h2>Introduction to Pencil Stencil</h2>
    <h3>
      Overview
    </h3>
    <p>
      Pencil controls shapes in its document by mean of <i>stencils</i>.
      Each stencil (Rectangle, for example) is indeed a template to generate
      shapes. Each template defines:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>The look:</b> how the generated shape looks like by mean
          of SVG elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>For example: </em>the Rectangle stencil defines a shape
          formed by a single SVG <i>&lt;rect&gt;</i> element.
        </p>
        <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>The properties:</b> which properties the shape has plus
          optional extra constraints on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>For example:</em> the Rectangle stencil has a <i>'box'</i>
          property of type <i>Dimension</i>, a <i>'strokeStyle'</i>
          property of type <i>StrokeStyle</i> and a <i>'fillColor'</i>
          property of type <i>Color</i>.
        </p>
        <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>The behaviours:</b> how the shape's look is changed
          according to changes made to its properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>For example:</em> the Rectangle <i>&lt;rect&gt;</i>
          element has its <i>fill</i> and <i>fill-opacity</i>
          change to the <i>'fillColor'</i> property of the shape.
        </p>
        <br/>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <b>The actions: </b>which actions that external objects and
          users can ask the shape to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>For example:</em> the Rectangle stencil define a <i>'Remove
          border'</i> action to allow users setting the <i>'strokeStyle'</i>
          width property to <i>0px</i> <i>and hence makes the &lt;rect&gt;
          element's border disappeared.</i>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Stencils are organized in collections. Each collection contains a set of
      related stencils and can be installed into or uninstalled from Pencil
      using the collection manager.
    </p>
    <h3>
      The Process of Creating Shapes from Stencils
    </h3>
    <p>
      After being installed into Pencil, a stencil can be used to create shapes
      by dragging it into the drawing pane of a page. When a stencil is dropped
      into a page, the following actions will be taken by Pencil to create a
      shape for that stencil:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Creating a shape as an SVG element containing all SVG elements defined
          in the <i>content</i> section of the stencil definition.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Putting the create shape into the page content.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Setting initial values for all properties in the shape to the default
          values as defined in the stencil.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Applying all behaviors defined in the stencil to make the shape looks
          changed according to these initial property values.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
      Manipulating Shapes in the Drawing Page
    </h3>
    <p>
      After being successfully inserted into a page, a shape begins its life in
      that page. During the life, a shape may have its properties changed to the
      desired value of the user. Depending on the type, a property value can be
      changed in a specific way that is easiest to the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i><b>Note:</b> Pencil reserves the use of some special
      property names for pre-defined purposes. Please refer the <a href="~/wiki/ref/Special_properties.html">Special Property Names</a> document to
      have detailed information on how these property names can be used in your
      stencil.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>An example of this is that the <b>'box'</b> property of
      type <b>'Dimension'</b> should always be used to determined the
      dimension of the outmost box surrounding the shape.</i>
